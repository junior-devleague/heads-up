# heads-up

Form team bonds with group communication and collaboration in this activity where the group explains the word on their teammate's forehead!

## Objective

Break the ice, form team bonds within the classroom, and review terms learned previously. One student will hold a word card on their forehead. Members of their group will try to explain this concept to their team member. If the team member guesses the word correctly, they get a point!

## General

--------|------------
Class Size | 10+  
Instructors | 1+
Prep Time | 20-30 minutes
Activity Time | 15 - 20 minutes

## Preparation

Instructor should prepare the following:
* List of ~15+ cards (index cards, printout..etc.) with a term or concept.

## Activity

### Rules

* Try to keep the explanations technical/related to the class (but you can vary this depending on the level of difficulty)

### Arrangement

1. Form groups (if you can) in a circle.
2. Distribute cards facedown to each group.
3. Have a student in each group draw a card and hold it to their forehead.

### On your Mark, Get Set, Go!   
1. This group tries to explain the word to the person.
2. If the student holding the card guesses the word correctly, the group gets a point.

### Winner!
1. It can be point based (points awarded if the team guesses correctly), or based on the number of cards they are able to go through.

### Next Round
1. Next person in the circle draws a card and holds it on their forehead.
